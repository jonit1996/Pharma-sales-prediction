## Analysis

We employ data analysis techniques to gain insights into pharmaceutical sales trends, including seasonality, product performance, and market dynamics.

Based on the analysis we found the most sold product in the store is N02BE which is Other analgesics and antipyretics, Pyrazolones, and Anilides.
So we are going to build a model on that to focus on the next sale of that product 

## Sales Prediction

Our sales prediction model leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast the sales of the most sold product. 
It takes into account historical data and relevant features to make accurate predictions.

This is a time series data so we use ### ARIMA model

## Results

we use 1 1 1 as p d q values we got 96% accuracy on the test data we have given
